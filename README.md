# Mass add buildings or departments
Adds all buildings or departments within a CSV file. 

This script currently does not support special characters within the CSV file. To import buildings or departments with special character names in them, change them to the acceptable XML Code. Refer to https://www.dvteclipse.com/documentation/svlinter/How_to_use_special_characters_in_XML.3F.html#gsc.tab=0 for more information.

Update: Support for "&" characters has been added

## Future Implimentations

* Additional support for Special Characters
* GUI Interface
* Add a script that exports the information from AD
